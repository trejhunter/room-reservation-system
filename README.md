# Room Reservation System

This custom Google script extends Google Forms and Google Sheets capabilities by creating a reservation management system for administrators. This program is able to take manage multiple rooms and is linked directly to a Google Calendar. Upon completing the reservation Google Form, a new row is automatically added to a Google Sheet and administrators have the option to approve or decline the reservation directly from the sheet. Once a decision is made, the script then sends an email to the individual who made the form with the status of their reservation.

## Installation

Although Google scripts is essentially just javascript, I would recommend cloning the repo and then copy and pasting the code into a Google script since I don't think there is a way to edit google scripts outside of the browser.
